# bee-sim-knapsack

A whimsical example of a recursive algorithm used to solve the knapsack problem, using a fun bee simulation!

## Objective
Maximize the equal collection of nectar and pollen from flowers in a single trip, while keeping time and space complexity of the implementation as low as possible

## Constraints
1. Each flower provides a fixed amount of nectar and pollen
2. Each flower requires a fixed amount of energy to visit
3. The bee has a fixed amount of energy to spend
4. The bee can only visit each flower once
5. The bee can only carry a fixed amount of nectar and pollen
6. The bee must collect all nectar and pollen from a flower or none at all
