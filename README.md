# Bee Simulator - 0/1 Knapsack Problem & Recursion Demonstration üêùüåª

![CLI output from Bee Simulator](example.png "Title")

Simple example of the knapsack problem solved with a recursive algorithm, using a fun and whimsical CLI idle game/simulation about a nectar collecting bee!

Polynomial-time **(ùëÇ(ùëõ √ó ùëö)) implementation (n = number of flowers, m = max energy)**

## Objective
Maximize the amount of nectar a bee can harvest in a day without exceeding its available energy.

## Constraints
1. Each flower provides a fixed amount of nectar
2. Each flower requires a fixed amount of energy to visit
3. The bee has a fixed amount of energy to spend
4. The bee can only visit each flower once
5. The bee can only carry a fixed amount of nectar
6. The bee must collect all nectar from a flower or none at all (0/1)

## Key Concepts
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- Memoization
- Knapsack Problem
- Backtracking

## Install & Dependencies
You'll need Python 3.12 or later to run this project.

Run the following to install dependencies:
```bash 
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(Or on Windows)
```bash
  py -m pip install pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the simulation, execute the main script file:
```bash
py main.py
```

### Simulation Speed
The simulation speed can be adjusted by setting the `SPEED` environment variable. The smallest possible value is 0, which will run the simulation instantaneously. The default value is 1.

### Debugging
When running the main script file, set the DEBUG environment variable to `1` to enable debugging output.

### Tests
To run the tests, execute the test script file:
```bash
py -m unittest tests/test.py
```
**These tests evaluate the DP and traceback matrices against previously stored versions. If you adjust the code in a way so that the matrices have changed shape, the tests will fail. You must run the references file to update these. You should calculate the tiny_meadow flower set using an online knapsack tool or by hand and compare this with the table generated by Bee Simulator to ensure it is safe to regenerate the references. You can see the tiny_meadow DP and Traceback tables in the console by running the tests above**
```bash
py tests/references.py
```

## Uses
Some real-world applications of the knapsack problem include:
- Cost benefit analysis
  - Determining the most cost-effective way to spend a budget
- Resource allocation
  - Assigning resources to maximize output
- Sprint planning
  - Determining the most valuable tasks to complete in a sprint
- Investment
  - Selecting the best stocks to invest in given a set budget 

## Next Steps
This library could be a small part of a larger simulation or game. Some ideas for expanding the project include:
- Adding in pollen as a secondary resource to collect and balance
- Adding in distance between flowers that takes energy to traverse (Traveling Salesman Problem)
- Adding more bees, specialized roles, and other colony management mechanics
- Adding in predators, disease, weather, seasons, etc.

I'm sure the algorithm could be optimized further too. Such as possibly using a one dimensional array instead of a two-dimensional one for the DP table?
