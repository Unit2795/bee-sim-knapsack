# Bee Simulator - 0/1 Knapsack Problem & Recursion Demonstration

Example polynomial-time **(ùëÇ(ùëõ √ó ùëö))**  recursive algorithm used to solve the knapsack problem, using a fun bee simulation!

## Objective
Maximize the equal collection of nectar and pollen from flowers in a single trip, while keeping time and space complexity of the implementation as low as possible

## Constraints
1. Each flower provides a fixed amount of nectar
2. Each flower requires a fixed amount of energy to visit
3. The bee has a fixed amount of energy to spend
4. The bee can only visit each flower once
5. The bee can only carry a fixed amount of nectar
6. The bee must collect all nectar from a flower or none at all (0/1)

## Install & Dependencies
How to get the necessary dependencies installed to run this project

## Usage
How to run and configure the project

### Simulation Speed
The simulation speed can be adjusted by setting the `SPEED` environment variable. The smallest possible value is 0, which will run the simulation instantaneously. The default value is 1.

### Debugging
When running the main script file, set the DEBUG environment variable to `1` to enable debugging output.

## Uses
Additional uses of knapsack problem, especially real-world ones

## Next Steps
Ways in which the depth of the simulation could be enhanced, the complexity of the problem increased, or the performance of the algorithm improved
